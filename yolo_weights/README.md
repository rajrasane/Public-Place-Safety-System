# yolo_weights

This directory is meant to store the YOLO model weights required for object detection tasks.
The weights will be downloaded automatically when the script runs, and they will be stored here.
Please do not modify or delete the weights unless necessary for the model.

For more information, refer to the YOLO documentation.
